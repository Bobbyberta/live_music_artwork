   ```

2. **Serve the files locally** (required for microphone access)
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   
   # Option 2: Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
   
   # Option 3: Node.js
   npx http-server
   
   # Option 4: Live Server (VS Code extension)
   # Right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server"
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or your chosen port)

4. **Grant microphone permissions**
   Click "Start Visualization" and allow microphone access when prompted

## üéÆ Usage

### Basic Operation
1. Click **"Start Visualization"** to begin
2. Allow microphone access when prompted
3. **Use "Audio Test" mode first** to verify sound is being detected correctly
4. Play music or speak near the microphone
5. Watch as the visualizations respond to audio input

### üîß Audio Test Mode
Perfect for setup and troubleshooting:
- **Large volume meter** shows overall audio levels
- **Frequency range bars** for bass, mid, and high frequencies  
- **Dominant frequency display** with musical note detection
- **Beat detection indicator** flashes when rhythm is detected
- **Audio history graph** shows recent volume levels
- **Mini frequency spectrum** for detailed analysis
- **Status indicators** show sensitivity, sample rate, and detection status
- **Debug panel** displays technical information and system status

**Use this mode to ensure your microphone is working before switching to artistic visualizations!**

### Controls
- **Sensitivity Slider**: Adjust how responsive the visualizations are to audio (1 = less sensitive, 10 = very sensitive)
- **Visualization Mode**: Choose between Audio Test and Simple Pulse
- **Color Scheme**: Select the visual theme
- **Audio Level**: Monitor microphone input levels

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Space`: Toggle start/stop
- `Escape`: Stop visualization
- `F11`: Toggle fullscreen

### Optimization for Ceilidh Music

The application is specifically tuned for traditional Celtic music:

- **Fiddle range** (196-2093 Hz): Creates flowing, melodic patterns
- **Accordion/Concertina** (65-2093 Hz): Responds to harmonic content
- **Irish Flute/Whistle** (262-2093 Hz): Emphasizes higher frequency details
- **Bodhr√°n** (60-200 Hz): Triggers beat effects and bass visualizations
- **Uilleann Pipes** (466-932 Hz): Special recognition for chanter range

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Color Schemes
Edit the `colorSchemes` object in `visualizations.js`:

```javascript
yourScheme: {
    primary: ['#color1', '#color2', '#color3'],
    secondary: ['#color4', '#color5', '#color6'],
    accent: ['#color7', '#color8', '#color9']
}
```

### Adjusting Frequency Ranges
Modify the `frequencyRanges` in `audio.js` for different instruments:

```javascript
customInstrument: { min: 100, max: 1000 } // Hz
```

### Adding New Visualization Types
1. **Copy** `visualization-template.js` to understand the structure
2. **Add** your new mode to the `<select>` options in `index.html`
3. **Create** a new render method in the `VisualizationEngine` class
4. **Integrate** by adding a new case in the `animate()` method

See `visualization-template.js` for detailed examples and integration instructions.
