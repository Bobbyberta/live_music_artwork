### üéà Balloon Float Mode
A beautiful and sophisticated visualization perfect for live performances:

#### Core Features
- **25 floating balloons** with realistic physics and natural movement
- **Music-responsive colors** - each balloon's hue, saturation, and lightness respond to frequency, volume, and bass energy
- **Dynamic movement speed** - balloons rise faster during energetic music passages
- **Realistic details** - balloon shadows, highlights, strings, and natural wobble effects

#### Intelligent Popping System
The visualization features a sophisticated balloon popping system with multiple triggers:

1. **Volume Spike Detection** (Primary)
   - Continuously tracks volume history (2-second rolling average)
   - Detects sudden volume spikes relative to recent average
   - Small spikes (1.5x average) pop 1 balloon
   - Large spikes (3.0x+ average) pop up to 8 balloons
   - Perfect for capturing musical accents, drum hits, and dynamic changes

2. **Beat Detection** (Secondary)
   - Pops balloons on detected musical beats
   - Acts as backup when spike detection doesn't trigger
   - Tuned for Celtic rhythms (jigs, reels, hornpipes)

3. **Collision Detection**
   - When 3+ balloons overlap, one automatically pops
   - Prevents overcrowding and maintains visual balance

#### Debug Information
Toggle detailed real-time information including:
- Current volume vs rolling average with spike ratios
- Balloon count (total and visible)
- Music speed multiplier and beat detection status
- Pop event details with cause (spike/beat/collision)
- Volume history and detection thresholds
- Performance metrics and system status

**Perfect for live Celtic music, ambient performances, and interactive events!**

### Controls
- **Sensitivity Slider**: Adjust how responsive the visualizations are to audio (1 = less sensitive, 10 = very sensitive)
- **Visualization Mode**: Choose between Audio Test and Balloon Float
- **Debug Toggle**: Show/hide detailed information overlay (Balloon Float mode only)
- **Audio Level**: Monitor microphone input levels in real-time
- **Fullscreen Button**: Enter fullscreen mode for performances
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Access help for common audio setup issues

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Space`: Toggle start/stop
- `Escape`: Stop visualization
- `F11`: Toggle fullscreen

### Optimization for Ceilidh Music

The application is specifically tuned for traditional Celtic music:

- **Fiddle range** (196-2093 Hz): Creates flowing, melodic patterns
- **Accordion/Concertina** (65-2093 Hz): Responds to harmonic content
- **Irish Flute/Whistle** (262-2093 Hz): Emphasizes higher frequency details
- **Bodhr√°n** (60-200 Hz): Triggers beat effects and bass visualizations
- **Uilleann Pipes** (466-932 Hz): Special recognition for chanter range

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization & Advanced Features

### Balloon Float Console Commands
Open browser console (F12) to access advanced balloon settings:

```javascript
// Adjust spike detection sensitivity
liveMusicArtwork.visualizationEngine.setSpikeSettings({
    minSpikeThreshold: 2.0,    // Require 2x volume spike
    maxBalloonsPerSpike: 5     // Pop max 5 balloons
});

// Modify balloon behavior
liveMusicArtwork.visualizationEngine.setBalloonSettings({
    baseSpeed: 2.0,            // Faster balloon movement
    maxBalloons: 30            // More balloons on screen
});

// Toggle spike detection
liveMusicArtwork.visualizationEngine.toggleSpikeDetection(false);
```

### Adjusting Frequency Ranges
Modify the `frequencyRanges` in `audio.js` for different instruments:

```javascript
customInstrument: { min: 100, max: 1000 } // Hz
```

### Adding New Visualization Types
1. **Study** `balloon-float.js` to understand the current architecture
2. **Copy** `visualization-template.js` for structure guidance
3. **Add** your new mode to the `<select>` options in `index.html`
4. **Create** a new visualization file (e.g., `your-viz.js`)
5. **Include** the script in `index.html`
6. **Integrate** in `visualizations.js` constructor and animate method

### Balloon Float Color Customization
Balloon colors are automatically generated based on music, but you can adjust the color calculation:

```javascript
// Adjust how music affects balloon colors
liveMusicArtwork.visualizationEngine.balloonFloatViz.setColorInfluence({
    volumeInfluence: 0.6,      // More volume effect on brightness
    bassInfluence: 0.5         // More bass effect on warmth
});
```
