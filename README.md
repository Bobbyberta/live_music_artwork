## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with Web Audio API support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Microphone access permissions
- Local web server (for HTTPS requirements)

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/live_music_artwork.git
   cd live_music_artwork
   ```

2. **Serve the files locally** (required for microphone access)
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   
   # Option 2: Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
   
   # Option 3: Node.js
   npx http-server
   
   # Option 4: Live Server (VS Code extension)
   # Right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server"
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or your chosen port)

4. **Grant microphone permissions**
   Click "Start Visualization" and allow microphone access when prompted

## üéÆ Usage

### Basic Operation
1. Click **"Start Visualization"** to begin
2. Allow microphone access when prompted
3. Play music or speak near the microphone
4. Watch as the visualizations respond to audio input

### Controls
- **Sensitivity Slider**: Adjust how responsive the visualizations are to audio (1 = less sensitive, 10 = very sensitive)
- **Visualization Mode**: Choose how the two displays interact
- **Color Scheme**: Select the visual theme
- **Audio Level**: Monitor microphone input levels

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Space`: Toggle start/stop
- `Escape`: Stop visualization

### Optimization for Ceilidh Music

The application is specifically tuned for traditional Celtic music:

- **Fiddle range** (196-2093 Hz): Creates flowing, melodic patterns
- **Accordion/Concertina** (65-2093 Hz): Responds to harmonic content
- **Irish Flute/Whistle** (262-2093 Hz): Emphasizes higher frequency details
- **Bodhr√°n** (60-200 Hz): Triggers beat effects and bass visualizations
- **Uilleann Pipes** (466-932 Hz): Special recognition for chanter range

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Color Schemes
Edit the `colorSchemes` object in `visualizations.js`:

```javascript
yourScheme: {
    primary: ['#color1', '#color2', '#color3'],
    secondary: ['#color4', '#color5', '#color6'],
    accent: ['#color7', '#color8', '#color9']
}
```

### Adjusting Frequency Ranges
Modify the `frequencyRanges` in `audio.js` for different instruments:

```javascript
customInstrument: { min: 100, max: 1000 } // Hz
```

### Adding Visualization Modes
Extend the `VisualizationEngine` class with new rendering methods.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No microphone access**
- Ensure HTTPS connection (required for microphone API)
- Check browser permissions
- Try refreshing the page

**Poor visualization response**
- Increase sensitivity setting
- Check microphone input levels
- Ensure audio is actually reaching the microphone

**Performance issues**
- Close other browser tabs
- Reduce particle count in code
- Use smaller canvas sizes

**No audio detected**
- Check system microphone settings
- Ensure microphone isn't muted
- Try speaking directly into microphone
